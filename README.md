## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Starterpack stems from the desire to empower entrepreneurs with data-driven insights to enhance their startup success. We recognized the need for a tool that could leverage various factors and predict a startup's potential to reach the T500.

## What it does

Starterpack utilizes a classification model (XGBoost with SMOTE) to analyze diverse data points, such as industry, location, interview process, financing, and more. By inputting these parameters, entrepreneurs can obtain predictions on the success or failure of their startup and its potential to become a part of the T500.

## How we built it

To bring Starterpack to life, we employed various technologies and techniques. We developed a Flask API to enable dynamic functionality on the website. This was crucial since GitHub only supports static content, and the API allowed us to incorporate the classification model seamlessly into the platform.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the major challenges we faced was the need to launch our own Flask API to make the website fully functional. Overcoming this hurdle required careful consideration and implementation to ensure smooth integration between the front end and the classification model.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We take immense pride in successfully developing Starterpack, a comprehensive tool that harnesses the power of data to predict startup success. Our team's dedication and collaboration resulted in a user-friendly platform that can guide entrepreneurs in making informed decisions about their startups.

## What we learned

Throughout the development process, we gained valuable insights into working with complex datasets and implementing classification models. We deepened our understanding of Flask APIs and learned how to overcome challenges in integrating dynamic functionality within a static content framework.

## What's next for Starterpack

In the future, we envision expanding Starterpack's capabilities by incorporating additional features and refining the classification model. We aim to enhance the accuracy and scope of predictions, ensuring entrepreneurs receive the most relevant and insightful guidance for their startup journey.
