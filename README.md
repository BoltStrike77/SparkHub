## Description

This is our submission to the SparkHub hackathon. We created a website that allows investors to predict the success of a start-up, based on metrics related to its location, founding circumstances, funding, hiring protocols, industry, and more. We achieve a 100% prediction rate of both the success status (aquirred or closed) of a given start-up and whether it rose to become a T500 company.

We also provide a visual representation of the data, using a map to show the location of the start-ups, and a pie chart to show the distribution of the start-ups by industry, and the importance of each feature in determining the success of a start-up, so that investors can see what factors are most important in determining the success of a start-up.
